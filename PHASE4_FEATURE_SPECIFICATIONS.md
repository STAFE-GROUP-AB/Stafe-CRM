## Detailed Feature Specifications

### 🤖 AI & Machine Learning Suite

#### Smart Lead Scoring
**Market Gap**: While basic lead scoring exists in most CRMs, intelligent multi-factor scoring with real-time updates and behavioral analysis is limited.

**Technical Specification**:
- Machine learning model trained on historical conversion data
- Real-time scoring updates based on website behavior, email engagement, social activity
- Integration with external data sources (company growth, funding news, job postings)
- Predictive factors: demographic fit, behavioral engagement, intent signals, timing
- Score explanation with contributing factors and recommended actions

**Implementation Approach**:
```php
// New models
class LeadScore extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['contact_id', 'score', 'factors', 'updated_at'];
    protected $casts = ['factors' => 'array'];
}

class ScoringFactor extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'weight', 'calculation_method', 'is_active'];
}
```

    direction ENUM('inbound', 'outbound'),
    contact_id BIGINT,
    user_id BIGINT,
    content TEXT,
    metadata JSON,
    recording_url VARCHAR(255),
    transcript TEXT,
    sentiment_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    duration_seconds INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
